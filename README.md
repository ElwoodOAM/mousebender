# mousebender
A package for installing Python packages

## Goal

To provide a Python package that allows for installing other packages via an API (compared to [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/) through its CLI).

## Where does the name come from?
The customer from [Monty Python's cheese shop sketch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheese_Shop_sketch) is named "Mr. Mousebender". And in case you don't know, the original name of [PyPI](https://pypi.org/) was the Cheeseshop after the Monty Python sketch.
