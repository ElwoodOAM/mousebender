# mousebender
A package for installing Python packages

## Goal

* To provide a Python package that allows for installing other packages via an API (compared to [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/) and its CLI).
* To help discover gaps in standards and other packages for the stated purpose above.

### Non-goals

* Support Python 2.7 (it _might_ happen, but it isn't guaranteed)
* Support legacy solutions (if it isn't in a PEP then this package does not care about it)

## Where does the name come from?
The customer from [Monty Python's cheese shop sketch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheese_Shop_sketch) is named "Mr. Mousebender". And in case you don't know, the original name of [PyPI](https://pypi.org/) was the Cheeseshop after the Monty Python sketch.
